While Joan was a newcomer to the bakery business, Anton had over 30 years of experience in restaurants, bakery and ice cream manufacturing, over 20 of which were spent focused entirely on pies. In 2008 their son Niko joined the business bringing with him his passion for quality, and a desire to uphold and expand on the values on which his parents built their business.</h4>
